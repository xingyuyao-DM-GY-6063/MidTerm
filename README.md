# Mid Term Proposal

## What Book
The book i choose is *Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin*.It is a classic novel that explores the themes of love, marriage, class, and social expectations in early 19th-century England. The story centers around the intelligent and strong-willed Elizabeth Bennet and her evolving relationship with the wealthy but aloof Mr. Darcy.

## What aspect of the book will I include in my cover
 I will be focusing on the intricate design of the iconic Pride and Prejudice cover featuring a peacock with its feathers fanned out. The peacock serves as a symbol of vanity and beauty, themes that resonate with the characters' personal journeys throughout the novel. The feathers will animate to reflect both aesthetic beauty and underlying tension between characters.

## Is it interactive? Time-based? Both?
The cover will be interactive. The peacock feathers will change colors based on the user's mouse movement to represent shifts in character emotions and social interactions. Additionally, I plan to have the text subtly shift or animate over time, reflecting the gradual development of relationships and personal growth in the narrative.

## What ideas I'd like to explore or experiment with
I want to explore how I can use interactivity to visually represent the themes of the novel, such as vanity, love, and social dynamics. By using mouse events to change the colors of the feathers, I hope to capture the fluid nature of the characters' emotions. The subtle movement of the text will signify time and change within the story.

## Are there aspects of your project that are related to any of the readings weâ€™ve done?
This project relates to our readings on interaction design and how visual elements can tell a story. Specifically, it ties into the idea of using animation and time-based changes to reflect narrative progression and character development. The gradual color changes and animated text are inspired by discussions on how interactivity can influence user engagement and interpretation of the piece.
